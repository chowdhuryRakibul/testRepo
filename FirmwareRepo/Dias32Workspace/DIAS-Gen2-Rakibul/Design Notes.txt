Priority Notes:
SD3 -> GPS
SD2 -> Xbee
SD6 -> debug 

High priodity/fast interrupts:
PPS (E15??) Priority 1
ADC DRDY (E0) Priority 0
SPI receive Priority 0

OS aware:
PendSV Priority 3->4

gpt5(callback) Priority 2

I2C Priority 5

SDC Priority 9

UART2 Priority 6->3
UART3 Priority 12->3
UART6 Priority 12

Might need to move SD2 (xbee) receive isr callback code into isr to increase reliability or else move to UART driver with DMA
